This code is an implementation of BLS-GSM denoiding method proposed by Portilla
et al in 2003. Following is an outline to the main methods:


main(), main.cpp:28      (Program begins here)

    - Reading the input image using io_png_read_f32()
    - Adding noise using addnoise()
    - For color images and to enhance overall performance, color decorrelation is done using ColorTransform()
    - Apply BLS-GSM denoising algorithm to each channel, using denoi_BLS_GSM()
    - Inverse color decorrelation using ColorTransform()
    - Writing output denoised image using io_png_write_f32() 



denoi_BLS_GSM(), gsm.cpp:48

    - The implementation of BLS-GSM method begins by this function. 
    - Boundary extension using bound_extension()
    - Making a delta function
    - Decomposing the image into steerable pyramid, denoising each coefficient and then reconstructing using  decomp_reconst_full()


decomp_reconst_full(), gsm.cpp:159

    - This function decomposes the image into steerable pyramid, denoises each coefficient and then reconstructs finally
    - Building steerable pyramid using buildFullSFpyr2()
    - Denoise each subband using denoi_BLS_GSM_band()

denoi_BLS_GSM_band(), gsm.cpp:262
    - This function denoises one subband according to the BLS-GSM method
